<h1>100 Days 100 Projects</h1>

<!-- ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo) -->

<h2>Description</h2>
For the next 100 days, I will be embarking on an ambitious project to challenge my problem solving and critical thinking skills. I plan on posting one project a day, starting from the basics and gradually becoming more complex as the days go by. Daily projects are based on scenerio or with a goal set in place meant to develop python fundamentals, and by the end of the 100 days, I hope to have developed a comprehensive understanding of the language and its associated skills. This project is an exciting challenge which I am looking forward to, and I am confident that I can use it to acquire an extensive knowledge of Python.

What is Thonny? <br/>
<b>
Thonny is a Python programming environment designed to be beginner-friendly. It comes with Python 3.10 built-in and has a stripped-down user interface. It has features like a debugger, syntax error highlighting, code completion, and a system shell. It also has a GUI for pip package installation.</b>
